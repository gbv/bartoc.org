{"definition":{"en":["\"Every service or dataset in a distributed system makes claims about 'what it is' or 'what this item is' or 'what list this term comes from'. This means that \"Controlled Vocabularies\", or more generally classifiers are at the base of the interoperability stack. Every other service or dataset needs to be able to refer to items from lists, or the entire lists. In some cases such vocabularies can be used to populate menus. In other cases it is merely a matter of ensuring that comparisons are between like things. In the most sophisticated cases 'semantic mediation' relies on either reference vocabularies or at least requires that the definitions being compared are available through the same networks.<br />\nThe emergence of Semantic Web technologies has provided some powerful tools for formalizing definitions, vocabularies, and ontologies, in forms that also support reasoning and inferencing. In particular, the Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) is based on a vocabulary/thesaurus model, and was designed primarily to formalize existing vocabularies using the semantic web tools, and also smooth the transition towards the richer logic-based tools from ontology modeling.<br />\nHowever, so far the standards only provide very low-level interfaces to vocabulary data. For example, the basic query language for RDF data is SPARQL. While this is very powerful, it is at a low level similar to the relational database query language SQL. In the same way that standard database users would never interact with databases using SQL, standard vocabulary users should be provided with an appropriate interface which is based on the structure of vocabulary data, not generic RDF queries.<br />\nThis is the goal of the SISS Vocabulary Services project: to define a standard interface through which standard vocabularies can be provided to web users. The interface is primarily intended for machine-machine use, so that data providers can use HTTP links to vocabularies, data applications can be configured with standard terminology, and data clients can retrieve definitions or verify the existence of items claimed to be in particular vocabularies. Human interface in the form of web pages and forms are also required, but they are secondary to the data-oriented API.<br />\nNote that SISSvoc does not address the issue of vocabulary governance. Its goal is limited to providing a user-friendly web interface to a vocabulary already available from a SPARQL endpoint, [currently read-only]. Vocabulary governance is a tricky thing to generalize since it involves both technical and social aspects. For the SISSvoc deployments at CSIRO we manage the vocabulary content as RDF files in a VCS.

This opens up data sets to a whole world of possibilities for computer aided manipulation, distribution and long term reuse.\nAn example of how computers may benefit from the use of controlled vocabularies is in the summing of values taken from different data sets. For instance, one data set may have a column labelled \"Temperature of the water column\" and another might have \"water temperature\" or even \"temperature\". To the human eye, the similarity is obvious but a computer would not be able to interpret these as the same thing unless all the possible options were hard coded into its software. If data are marked up with the same terms, this problem is resolved.\nIn the real world, it is not always possible or agreeable for data providers to use the same terms. In such cases, controlled vocabularies can be used as a medium to which data centres can map their equivalent terms.\nThe controlled vocabularies delivered by the NERC Vocabulary Server contain the following information for each term:\n    Key — a compact permanent identifier for the term, designed for computer storage rather than human readability<br />\n    Term — the text string representing the term in human-readable form<br />\n    Abbreviation — a concise text string representing the term in human-readable form where space is limited<br />\n    Definition — a full description of what is meant by the term\nAll of the vocabularies are fully versioned and a permanent record is kept of all changes made.\nVersion 2.0 of the Server (NVS2.0), developed as part of the Open Service Network for Marine Environmental Data (NETMAR) programme, represents a complete rewrite of the internal software with both increased functionality and performance.

{"definition":{"en":["Knowledge for All is a collaborative project to develop the first free, open tool of its kind for discovering, sharing and accessing scholarly journal literature. Based out of the University of Prince Edward Island with support from the Council of Atlantic University Libraries, the project invites all members of the international library and academic community, along with creators, managers and seekers of scholarly literature across the board to participate in building an open index and search tool that will truly meet their needs.\nThe tool will allow institutions, universities, libraries, archives, researchers, academics, students and members of the public at large to search across all academic disciplines and freely access a comprehensive collection of scholarly journal content. Its software and data will be open and freely available for the benefit of the community. The tool is being developed using a collaborative model - academic and library institutions around the world share in project costs, content creation and system development. They contribute funding, time and skills to build Knowledge for All for their own benefit and eliminate dependence on expensive proprietary databases and products. As an open source, customizable tool with robust search features, Knowledge for All will give institutions and individuals control over their content and technology.\nWe need your input in developing Knowledge for All.  Visit our Get Involved page to learn how you can contribute and register to join the Knowledge for All community.\n"]},"prefLabel":{"en":"Knowledge for All"},"type":["http://purl.org/cld/cdtype/CatalogueOrIndex"],"uri":"http://bartoc.org/en/node/1718","url":"http://www.k4all.ca/"}

It is used by national and local governments, research institutions, and other organisations which collect a lot of data. With its powerful search and faceting, users can browse and find the data they need, and preview it using maps, graphs and tables - whether they are developers, journalists, researchers, NGOs, citizens or your own colleagues.\nCKAN is free, open-source software, which has been developed by the Open Knowledge Foundation since 2006 and used by government and organisations around the world. Version 2.0 was released in May 2013.\n<strong>About the Datahub</strong>\nThe Datahub provides free access to many of CKAN's core features, letting you search for data, register published datasets, create and manage groups of datasets, and get updates from datasets and groups you're interested in. You can use the web interface or, if you are a programmer needing to connect the Datahub with another app, the CKAN API.\n<strong>Getting started</strong>\nFeel free to sign up - it will only take a minute. If you haven't used CKAN before, have a look at the User Guide, and try it out at demo.ckan.org. This is a demo instance - feel free to try out creating and editing datasets and groups.\n<strong>Using groups</strong>\nYou can use CKAN Groups to create and manage collections of datasets. This could be to catalogue datasets for a particular project or team, or on a particular theme, or as a very simple way to help people find and search your own published datasets.\n"]},"identifier":["http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q18814247"],"prefLabel":{"en":"DataHub"},"type":["http://purl.org/cld/cdtype/CatalogueOrIndex","http://bartoc.org/full-repository"],"uri":"http://bartoc.org/en/node/1715","url":"http://datahub.io/"}
